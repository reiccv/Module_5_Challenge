# Module 5 Challenge

In this Challenge, ill create two financial analysis tools by using a single Jupyter notebook:

Part 1: A financial planner for emergencies. The members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

Part 2: A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.


# Imports

The imports, libraries and dependecies I used for this financial analysis tool are  os, requests, json, pandas, dotenv, alpaca_trade_api and 
MCForecastTools
